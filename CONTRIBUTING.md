# Contributing to Factory Paper Size Standard (FPSS)

Thanks for helping build an open, interoperable, and sustainable manufacturing standard.

## Ways to contribute
- **Docs & spec:** Fix typos, add clarifications, propose new tables/schemas.
- **Reference designs:** CAD, BOMs, assembly guides, calibration routines.
- **Software:** Job packet tooling, simulators, station drivers.
- **Build logs:** Photos, lessons learned, substitutions.

## Workflow
1. **Fork** the repo and create a feature branch.
2. If you propose a **spec change**, open a **Discussion** first.
3. Submit a **PR** referencing any related issues/discussions.
4. For hardware, include: CAD, exploded view, **BOM.csv**, and **assembly_guide.md**.
5. For software, include tests where sensible.

## Style
- Markdown with concise headings.
- Diagrams as SVG or PNG.
- Use SI units.
- Prefer abundant/sustainable materials; note hazards in **materials passports**.
