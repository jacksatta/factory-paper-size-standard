# Governance (v0.1)

- **Stewards:** Repo maintainers curate the spec, triage issues, and merge PRs.
- **Proposals:** Major changes start as GitHub Discussions, then PRs with an ADR (Architecture Decision Record).
- **Releases:** Spec versions are tagged `spec-vX.Y`. Reference designs and software follow semantic versioning.
- **Working Groups (WGs):**
  - WG‑Spec (tables, schemas, protocols)
  - WG‑Human‑Module (reference container build)
  - WG‑Robots (parent/child cells)
  - WG‑Sustainability (materials passports, energy)
