# The Factory Paper Size Manifesto

We are building a manufacturing language for the planet.

It works from the size of a desktop 3D printer to the scale of an aircraft hangar, so anyone, anywhere, can make what they need from sustainable materials. This is not a software dream — it’s hardware you can build today, guided by open-source plans, that speaks to every other factory built to the standard.

In 90 days, you could have your first human-scale microfactory running, producing parts for bigger factories or smaller ones, and connected to a global network of makers and engineers.

Our aim: speed, sustainability, and self-reliance — for everyone.

## Our Commitments
1. **Interoperability** — All FPSS modules can exchange jobs, materials, and QA data without friction.
2. **Scalability** — Start small, grow big. A nano-module can feed a micro-module, which can feed a macro-module.
3. **Sustainability** — Abundant, recyclable, and ethically sourced materials.
4. **Openness** — The standard is open and free; reference designs are open-source.
5. **Practicality** — Everything here can be built today with available parts.

## Robots That Build Robots
The FPSS is also a blueprint for *makers of machines*.  
Every FPSS module should eventually be able to build part or all of another FPSS module, enabling self-expanding manufacturing networks.

This matters for:
- **Disaster recovery** — seed a factory and grow local production.
- **Space development** — bootstrap industry from small payloads.
- **Economic resilience** — communities grow their own manufacturing.
- **Environmental responsibility** — build new modules from recycled feedstock.
