# The Factory Paper Size Manifesto

We are building a manufacturing language for the planet.

It works from the size of a desktop 3D printer to the scale of an aircraft hangar, so anyone, anywhere, can make what they need from sustainable materials. This is not a software dream — it’s hardware you can build today, guided by open-source plans, that speaks to every other factory built to the standard.

In 90 days, you could have your first human-scale microfactory running, producing parts for bigger factories or smaller ones, and connected to a global network of makers and engineers.

Our aim: speed, sustainability, and self-reliance — for everyone.

## Our Commitments
1. **Interoperability** — All FPSS modules, regardless of who builds them, can exchange jobs, materials, and QA data without friction.
2. **Scalability** — Start small, grow big. A nano-module can feed a micro-module, which can feed a macro-module.
3. **Sustainability** — Preference for abundant, recyclable, and ethically sourced materials.
4. **Openness** — The standard is open and free; reference designs are open-source.
5. **Practicality** — Everything here can be built today with available parts.

## How to Join
- **Build**: Start with the human-scale reference design and make your first module.
- **Connect**: Link your module with others to exchange jobs.
- **Improve**: Submit pull requests to refine the standard.
- **Share**: Post your build logs, tutorials, and designs.

We are not just publishing a spec — we are building a movement.
