# Factory Paper Size Standard (FPSS) — v0.1

**An open manufacturing standard for interoperable, scalable, and sustainable production.**

The Factory Paper Size Standard defines how manufacturing modules — from nano-scale to warehouse-scale — can connect, share jobs, and grow by building the next size up.  
Just like paper sizes nest into each other (A5 → A4 → A3), FPSS modules nest in *capability* and *output*, using fixed scaling ratios, standard material cartridges, and a shared digital job language.

## Why
- **Resilience:** Make what you need locally, without fragile global supply chains.
- **Sustainability:** Built-in preference for abundant, recyclable materials.
- **Scalability:** Microfactories can feed macrofactories without redesign.
- **Innovation speed:** AI can design, test, and produce new products faster when hardware follows a known standard.

## How
1. **Choose a size class** (nano, micro, human, macro).
2. **Download the open-source CAD & BOM** for that class.
3. **Assemble your module** using off-the-shelf parts.
4. **Run a job packet** — the universal file format that tells any FPSS-compliant module what to make, what from, and how to verify it.
5. **Share your build** and connect it to others.
